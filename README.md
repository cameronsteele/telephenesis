# Telephenesis

Telephenesis (https://telephenesis.com) is a visualization of the metamorphosis of a musical idea as it is reinterpreted and recreated by different artists. It's like the game "Telephone", but with music.

One artist composes a piece of music and uploads it in digital form to the website. It is then visualized as a star floating in an outerspace interface. Listeners can click on the stars to listen to the track. Artists can remix or recreate tracks and upload them to be represented as a growing constellation of the progression of musical ideas as they are relayed from one creative mind to another.
